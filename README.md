# Ideas for a Resource Based Currency System

## The Problem(s) with Money
Conventional money is a tool that has intractable flaws, chief among them is it attempts to measure value across hugely disparate systems with no regard for underlying physical reality (energy and ecology blindness, Nate Hagens can explain).

In todayâ€™s world a $5 bill will get you enough gasoline to send a 3 ton vehicle to the next city at 65mph, or pay for a song from someone playing a guitar on the street; the resources used for these activities are vastly different but somehow money considers them equal.

That gasoline, once expended, is gone for all time; whether the vehicle was a lifted pickup truck roaling coal with no cargo or an ambulance carrying a child, the gasoline is gone. Every useless pickup truck mile driven is one less ambulance mile available for the rest of history. Money doesn't understand or measure that, maybe the cost of gasoline will go up over time as it becomes more scarce, but that doesn't fix the fact it is being wasted beforehand. Money inherently exists in the present, thinking only about the next move without acknowledging how many moves remain.

Money also does not care about damage to the environment, and in fact any side-effects or externalities from an activity only get priced if laws force them to be. Parties looking to make money are incentivized to work against this happening, so you end up with pro-business interests acting as anti-environment lobbyists. Big moral hazard.

Money under our current system is created when a bank loans it into existence, banks follow rules on how much they can loan but those rules are not based on any measure of reality, banks assume the resources the money is purchasing can be extracted without any issues. Control of the banks controls how much resources are extracted and who gets them.

Lastly, money fails to give equity; we all must live on the same planet and share the same resources. The fairest way to do that would be to give equal claim to them. The only thing we cannot split fairly is the fruit of effort, which we must acknowledge can be valued differently.

## Basic Pitch for a Solution
I propose money be split up into separate currencies that measure physical reality and human effort, and that are *not* directly interchangeable. Furthermore, for the physical currencies, I propose we set absolute limits to them based on collectively determined sustainable metrics (Kate Raworth's doughnut economics points towards this). All goods and activities would be priced in a combination of these currencies.
> Think about the game StarCraft, when you want to build something instead of using money you use a combination of minerals and vespene gas. Without enough of one or the other you cannot build, there is no interchanging them. Our current money papers over the difference without regard to how many resources are on the map.

### The Rationale for Rationing


## Types of Resource Currency

### Energy

### Space Impact

### Element Usage

### Time

## TL;DR Table

| | Energy | Space Impact | Element Usage | Time | Money |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |  ----- |
| Measured in | Fossil-Fuel energy equivalent unit | area | weight | hours | Conventional Currency |
| Distributed | Equally | Equally | Equally | Based on Relative Demand for Skill | By how much others will pay |
| How to pay less | Use Renwable/High EROEI Energy, pick energy efficient materials and processes | Preserve virgin land, contain runoff | Avoid High-Tech when possible, Split ownership | Split the cost with more people, pick the more automated version when possible | Buy from exploited workers and environment |
| Limited by | Worldwide energy resources usable within climate bounds | Area of Earth needed to reverse mass extinction | Amount of recoverable resources | Relative Demand calculation within a limit, 1:12 | No limit until banking crisis |
