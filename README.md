# Ideas for a Resource Based Currency System

## The Problem(s) with Money
Conventional money is a tool that has intractable flaws, chief among them is it attempts to measure value across hugely disparate systems with no regard for underlying physical reality (energy and ecology blindness, Nate Hagens can explain).

In today’s world a $5 bill will get you enough gasoline to send a 3 ton vehicle to the next city at 65mph, or pay for a song from someone playing a guitar on the street; the resources used for these activities are vastly different but somehow money considers them equal. Gasoline, once expended, is effectively gone for all time; whether the vehicle was a lifted pickup truck rolling coal with no cargo in the bed or an ambulance carrying a sick child, the gasoline is gone. Every useless pickup truck mile driven is one less ambulance mile available for the rest of history. Money doesn't understand or measure that, maybe the cost of gasoline will go up over time as it becomes more scarce, but that doesn't fix the fact it is being wasted beforehand. Money inherently exists in the present, thinking only about the next move without acknowledging how many moves remain.

Money also does not care about damage to the environment, and in fact any side-effects or externalities from an activity only get priced if laws force them to be. Parties looking to make money are incentivized to work against this happening, so you end up with pro-business interests acting as anti-environment lobbyists. Big moral hazard.

Money under our current system is created when a bank loans it into existence, banks follow rules on how much they can loan but those rules are not based on any measure of reality, banks assume the resources the money is purchasing can be extracted without any issues. Control of the banks controls how much resources are extracted and who gets them. Geopolitical forces extend this network of control worldwide.

Money only values exchange on the market, therefore the caring economy (which contributes massive value to wellbeing) is left without compensation.

Lastly, money fails to give equity; we all must live on the same planet and share the same resources. The fairest way to do that would be to give equal claim to them. The only thing we cannot split fairly is the fruit of effort, which we must acknowledge can be valued differently.

These issues must form the guides for a replacement system.

## Basic Pitch for a Solution
I propose money be split up into separate currencies that measure physical reality and human effort, and that are *not* directly interchangeable. Furthermore, for the physical currencies, I propose we set absolute limits to them based on collectively determined sustainable metrics (Kate Raworth's doughnut economics points towards this). All goods and activities would be priced in a combination of these currencies.
> Think about the game StarCraft, when you want to build something instead of using money you use a combination of minerals and vespene gas. Without enough of one or the other you cannot build, there is no interchanging them. Our current money papers over the difference without regard to how many resources are on the map.

### The Rationale for Rationing
Science can try to tell us how much of a resource is left, what is possible to extract, and what effects we will have on the environment. In order to avoid overshooting planetary bounds (further) we must implement rationing to fall within these bounds. The dichotomy between the poorest and the richest people will need to be corrected, we can no longer afford to give some outsized privileges while others suffer.

## Types of Resource Currency
My proposed currencies will be split between Physical Resources and Human Time/Effort. Each will behave differently.

### Energy
All activities rely on some form of energy, historically that would come from human/animal strength or the burning of biomass. The Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI) was generally low for these sources, meaning not much was left to spare for investing. Mankind eventually figured out how to exploit massive stores of fossil fuel energy, and later nuclear energy. We also discovered natural flows of energy like the wind and sunlight that could be harnessed with some investment.

We do not want to keep using fossil fuels because they are destroying the environment, and we really should not be wasting them on activities that have lower consumption alternatives because they are limited. Therefore, the Energy Currency will be measured in Fossil Fuel Equivalent units.

Look at heating a house as an example. You could heat your house with a fossil fuel or a heat pump. You could use 1 unit of fossil energy to heat the house, or you could use that unit of energy to build a solar heating system. In the long run the solar heating system will require less fossil energy than burning it directly, meaning your ration will be usable for other purposes.

From an EROEI perspective, each unit of fossil energy invested might yield 20 units of solar energy over time; therefore the price of a good or service produced using the solar energy will be 1/20th of that made directly with fossil energy. The second generation of solar made just using solar might price things at 1/40th the energy cost. The long term goal is to make a self-expanding power base that can exist without fossil inputs.

Instead of making fossil fuels more expensive as they become rarer, as conventional money would, this currency makes renewables cheaper. Because people have a rationed amount of energy currency over a lifetime, they know they must stretch it, and they are allowed to do so now instead of scrambling later.

### Space Impact
Everything we do has an effect on the ecosystem, from destroying woods to plant crops, to polluting waterways with fertilizer and mining runoff, to the greenhouses gases emitted which cause the planet to warm. Science can tell us what our overshoot boundaries might look like and what activities would push them worst. Everyone gets a ration of space impacted equivalent to an area of the earth within that overall boundary estimate.

Your home takes up a certain amount of space, the roads you drive on and have goods delivered on take up space, the farms and factories take up space. To make the most of your ration, you will want to minimize all of those in ways that make sense to you. Denser, car-free population centers will be cheaper to live in. Eating less meat will be cheaper, food grown on your roof will be cheaper than food transported from hundreds of miles away. Redeveloping land that is already disrupted will be cheaper than disturbing virgin ecosystems, and ecologically sensitive areas will cost even more still.

The goal is for incentives to align between the cost of doing things and the impact they will have on earth. More sustainable activities should be cheaper.

### Element Usage
Some activities require very limited elements. Most wires require copper, some batteries require lithium, computer chips might need cobalt, concrete might need good sand. We must do our best to measure what exists and is recoverable and split the rights to them equally, otherwise the developed countries will siphon away the rarest ones for their own purposes. Under our current system cobalt miners may never get to own the computers their labor makes possible.

This would be a collection of sub-currencies for each element, when you are in the market for something you can get more of things that require less rare elements. You might want to shop around, consider sodium chemistry batteries vs. lithium for example.

Proper recycling would be way more important, getting a new phone without recycling the old one properly would come out of your lifetime possible resource.

### Time
All the currencies mentioned up until now have been things that the earth provides, which should be equally distributed, but humans can choose how to spend their time, and we must measure demand for skills to have a market that functionally serves them.

Centrally planned economies can misallocate people to tasks, but market economies fail in a different way by using money as the demand signal. An economy based on normal money meets the demands of those with money preferentially over those that do not. If we believe the purpose of an economy is to fairly and efficiently distribute goods and services we need to measure demand and pay in separate steps.

Take for example a doctor. Becoming a doctor is difficult so the skill set is rare, so under our current monetary system you must pay more for a doctor. Everyone needs a doctor though, so the poor cannot express their demand need accurately; even though they need a doctor they cannot afford one. Single-payer healthcare can solve this issue to some extent, but then society gets into an argument over who should pay taxes to pay for that, meaning there is constant friction to providing it. The same demand dynamic applies to everything else!

The solution to this is to have everyone's time valued the same at the point of sale, so people can truthfully demand what they would like, but then to have a calculated relative demand payment given to the provider.

Going back to the doctor, say a taxi driver needs a 1 hour doctor's appointment. The taxi driver pays 1 hour of their time currency and goes about their day; the system sees how in-demand doctors are relative to factors like how many there are in the area and how many people rely on them, then awards them with a payment of 1hr plus some multiplier. There would need to be some kind of limit to how high the multiplier would go to avoid insane overpayments, maybe some ratio based on normal hours worked in a day like 1:8 or 1:12.

So the doctor might have earned as much as 8 hours to spend on goods/services. The doctor is only one person worth of demand, and they cannot overpay someone for their time, so when they go to spend it they are limited in how much the market can be distorted in their favor. Maybe they would hire a housekeeper, but the housekeeper would have to judge if the multiplier for their service was worth accepting, or if they had a more lucrative area to apply their skills to. The doctor might be able to provide a steady income, but the demand for housekeepers in the greater context of society determines the multiplier.

Because the currencies are not interchangeable, earning a massive amount of time currency would not mean that those with more demanded skills could buy vastly more stuff; they still must operate under the other resource limits. It is fully expected that it might be difficult to spend all their acquired time currency, although they could use it to purchase services and things like art more than an average person. It could also be held for retirement or donated.

Products made using less human input would cost less time currency, automation can be a good thing as long as other resources are considered.

Services that are shared by multiple people can have their costs split, a personal tutor might cost 1 hr for 1 hr, but a teacher might only charge each of their 30 students only 2 minutes (the teacher then receiving a multiplier by their relative demand). Online content might be incredibly cheap to consume but the creators would receive compensation without having ads. Patents couldn't be locked away, the inventors would simply get compensated commensurate with the usage. There would still be limits to total compensation.

Since relative demand would need to be calculated, it would also be made transparently available so people can see what skills they might want to develop or where they might relocate to earn more. Doing market research would be far easier for starting a business.

## TL;DR Table

| | Energy | Space Impact | Element Usage | Time | Money |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |  ----- |
| Measured in | Fossil-Fuel energy equivalent units | Area | Weight | Hours | Conventional Currency |
| Distributed | Equally | Equally | Equally | Based on Relative Demand for Skill | ❌By how much others will pay |
| How to pay less | Use Renwable/High EROEI Energy, pick energy efficient materials and processes | Preserve virgin land, contain runoff | Avoid High-Tech rare elements when possible, Split ownership | Split the cost with more people, pick the more automated version when possible (remembering other costs) | ❌Buy from exploited workers and environment |
| Limited by | Worldwide energy resources usable within climate bounds | Area of Earth needed to reverse mass extinction | Amount of recoverable resources | Relative Demand calculation within a limit, TBD 1:8/1:12/1:24/... | ❌No limit until banking crisis |

## Pricing of Goods and Services under the new Currencies
Every good would be priced in a combination of all the currencies, you would need to have enough of each to make a purchase. Because everyone is issued the same ration (except for Time), there are no profits in the system. A producer uses their rations to make the product, when a consumer buys it the producer's ration is restored. There is thus an extremely strong incentive not to overproduce, or produce things that aren't in demand, so consumers and producers might work more closely to match output. Underproduction is a possibility, but because the relative demand for a product/service will be calculated and time bonuses awarded, producers will be incentivized to meet demand.

Unlike normal money, pricing would not be based on arbitrary estimates of value. Producers would track their inputs all the way up to when the consumer makes a purchase. Independent auditors working on behalf of consumers would be following the process along the way to ensure it was done fairly. When overproduction does occur, the independent auditors would determine when and how much it would be appropriate to discount the good; this would not mean the cost was written off, just that the producer and consumer would be sharing it.

Advertising costs could not be included in the cost of a product, this means the producer would need to determine if spending on it out of pocket would be worth the extra relative demand generated. Being that some of those advertising costs would be coming from their own rationed currencies, they would really need to consider it well in relation to the time currency they could earn more of. Being that the goal of society is to consume less materials, structurally disincentivizing advertising is a desired feature.

### Long Term Dynamic Prices
One of the biggest differences between this system and traditional money is that the price is not fixed in time to when you purchase something. Depending on environmental impact your cost could raise or lower over time after the purchase is made.

As an example, one chair is made of wood, another is made of plastic. The plastic chair might be easier to mass produce, costing less time currency, but the material it uses creates a nearly permanent impact on the environment, taking a block of your Space Impact currency for a long time. The wood chair is handmade, so you might pay more in time currency for the craftsmanship, but the land the wood was grown on might be managed well and growing more trees, so your Space Impact currency ration would be restored to you eventually.

Scientists might find out a chemical in your tires is killing fish, so the tires become more expensive after the fact; you now have incentive to have this studied in advance so you don't get surprised like that.

Getting accurate estimates on the long term cost of a good would be important and normal. Buying a house made of cheap materials that leak energy could easily cost more in the long run. Producers may be responsible for all or part of the cost of disposal of a good to discourage planned obsolescence. When this kind of information becomes easily accessible and widespread we will see behavior changes, sustainable processes will be in higher demand so the market will shift towards them.

You can be proactive about restoring the environment as well, investing your resources to recovery efforts can actually yield a return of rations. Investing in renewables to be used in the chain of products you want can make them cost less, and companies that want to be competitive would do the same so they could charge less and be less out from overproduction.

### A Balancing Act
Because the currencies are not directly exchangeable, consumers will need to be more mindful of how they spend. Information on pricing will be far more easily obtained, so making those decisions will not be a shot in the dark. We are at our most creative when we are working within limits, artists need the limits of their medium to push against, and necessity is the mother of invention. When you work within limits you must figure out what is actually important, hoarding endless wealth does not seem to produce contentment.

## The Power of Sharing
*In Progress, tl;dr the best way to avoid spending too much on something is to share it amongst the community. Tool libraries, municipal motorpools, solarpunk community centers, all give people access to more wealth and services than simply buying something. There should be a mechanism in place where people can give things over to the public in exchange for part of the cost back. Everyone's first instinct should be to find out if what they need can be borrowed rather than bought.*
The goal 

## How Investment Works\How Businesses Form
*In Progress, communities and consumer groups can determine what they are missing and allocate currency towards the development of businesses to meet their needs. The cost of capital would be fractionally priced into all the goods produced on it, so good decisions in meeting demand result in lower prices for the end users over time.*

## Children, Retirement, and Inheritance


## Socially Agreed Upon Uses
*In Progress, tl;dr the market cannot directly cover everything so there needs to be a mechanism for people to allocate resources to shared uses. Auditors of the system would need compensation.*

### The Caring Economy
*In Progress, tl;dr people should be compensated for things like caring for children, the elderly, and the disabled, or even just providing therapy, even if those groups do not have a budget for it.*

### A Replacement for Taxes
In the current monetary system, taxes are taken from people and businesses and used to pay for government services. This inherently leads to social friction; no one wants to pay taxes, and those with wealth and power use their leverage to reduce their tax burden or cause the government to provide less services. Resentment builds and spills over into strife.

Instead of messing with all of that, governments will simply get a portion of the overall global physical currency budget proportional to the amount of people they govern. In effect everyone would be paying the exact same amount of taxes, because everyone is receiving rights to the same amount of resources after this allocation.

Governments might be more or less efficient with these resources, but they could never force people to pay more in taxes, or go into debt where they must pay back with interest.

Crucially, the physical resources set aside for government does not go towards paying government employees; they receive a normal ration like everyone else. The government physical resources are strictly for projects and services.

In many ways the new system eliminates most of the need for many government programs. The need for social security/retirement programs/disability is largely removed because everyone is already entitled to physical resources, governments would only need to shore up people with unusual circumstances.

Governments can set activities by government employees as being compensated in time currency without their citizens having to pay directly, they may even be able to set the compensation multiplier. Teachers would be a good example of workers that need to be paid sufficiently to retain them, and if the relative demand from parents for their services was too low to be attractive the government might need to step in and set a better multiplier. Taking the burden of paying off of the most vulnerable

*In Progress, tl;dr taxes don't need to come from people directly, necessary services need to have resources set aside from the overall total. People should have some control over how this stuff is spent.*

## How the Currency is Administered
*In Progress*
Finally, a use for blockchain /s

This area needs engineering, the goal is basically to get a secure, decentralized network that does not require tremendous amounts of energy. The currency would not be administered by any particular government, participation in the system is voluntary and cooperative, and independent validation is needed to keep everything honest and level. Ideally this would not require everyone to have a computer, although Africa has been readily adopting cellphone based money, so it might not be unfeasible for even very poor people to adopt.

Ideas for subsections/elaborations...
Areas of your Physical Resource Ration are set aside for basic life necessities, a portion is dedicated to housing, another is dynamically set aside based on consumption patterns predicted out into the future. Everything beyond that is more or less free to use.

Priority: those people without a good or service get priority when ordering them. Someone without a house gets to have their need for one met before someone else’s second house is built or bought. There is no out-bidding process.*

## Implementation
*In Progress* Daniel Schmachtenberger talks about a concept called Game B, that exists alongside our current system but eventually overcomes and supplants it. Rationed currency may not be attractive to people that are extremely wealthy and powerful and wasteful, but having an equal share of the world's resources would be a better deal for those who are in poverty. If the hardworking people in countries colonized by the wasteful world system begin cooperating and demanding their fair share, the rich may have no choice but to acquiesce. If people in the new system can get better services amongst eachother without money, money itself would become less valuable. The wealthy joining the system would need to discard down to a sustainable level to participate; they might find themselves in a mansion with no currency to buy food or keep the lights on. A potato might cost them $10 as they try to spend their depreciating fiat currency on a populace that has moved on. War should be met with heavy sanctions, it should not be possible to kill or steal from another group without long lasting consequences that result in leadership change.
